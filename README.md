# creative-coding
This project makes use of the canvas-sketch library for creative visualization.
The following command installs canvas-sketch globally:
```
npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g
```

To make a new file:
```
canvas-sketch example.js
```

If everything worked successfully, you will now see a message in the terminal:
```
Server running at [IP_ADDRESS].
```
The sketch is displayed on this address, and can be viewed with any browser. You can also open existing files with ```canvas-sketch [filename]```.
